                <li><b>What are the differences between the various colored pins??</b></li>
                Red pins are charge points for Mahindra Electric cars only.
                Green pins are charge points for all EV's.
                Black pins are points created by Ather Energy.
                Orange pins are Battery Swapping Stations installed by Sun Mobility.
                Blue pins are DC fast charging stations.

                <li><b>How can i be sure if the community charging station is safe to use?</b></li>
                  Most points are tested and verified by our teams.  If for some reason, we cannot verify the station we will rely on the community to test these stations.
                  <BR>
                <li><b>Can i call before visiting?</b></li>
                    Yes. Most community charge points will have a contact number.

                <li><b>Will we have support from RE:CHARGE or PluginIndia.com, if something goes wrong?</b></li>
                This is a community initiative. PluginIndia.com is only acting as a facilitator between the owner of the charging station and the community.
                So there wont be support. But you can visit our site and contact us, if you want help. We always check our messages and we will get back to you.

                <li><b>If this free or paid?</b></li>
                    That depends on the business or the person responsible for those charging stations.  Some might offer it as a free service some might take a small fee. The fee depends on the owner but we will ensure it is nominal.

                <li><b>I want to help the EV community and setup a station at my business.  But i want to charge the consumer. What are your guidelines regarding prices?</b></li>
                    Great! Charge a nominal rate based on the cost of electricity in your area.  Generally electric cars consume 2 kWh (2 units), when charged for an hour.  Although it depends on the model.  And e-Scooters consume less than a unit of electricity for 1 hour of charging.
                  <BR>
                <li><b>Why are you doing this?</b></li>
                    We @ PluginIndia wants to see as many EV's possible on Indian roads.  And we don't see active progress made by corporations or the government in setting up DC Quick charge charging stations. Meanwhile, the community can setup these stations which will help EV owners go beyond their city on weekends or for work without worrying about charge running out.
                        These stations will also act as an incentive for a potential EV buyer to go for these environment friendly vehicles.
                  <BR>
                <li><b>Anything else?</b></li>
                    Before we publish these charging stations, we visit, test them and get to know the owners. Rest assured we only publish stations owned by people who are interested in supporting the cause of EV's. PluginIndia.com is not responsible for any issues or problems that arises.
