        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        The RE:CHARGEINDIA app is bought to you by PluginIndia.com along with the Delhi and Pune Electric Car community for the benefit of the greater Indian EV community.

        <br><br>
        <h2>What is PluginIndia.com?</h2>
        We @PluginIndia are passionate about Electric Vehicles and Clean energy. Our aim is to accelerate the shift to plug-in vehicles powered by clean, affordable, domestic electricity to reduce our country's dependence on imported oil and thus improve the global environment. <br><br>
        
        We have started doing this by creating content (blogs, videos, reviews) that helps in spreading awareness of electric vehicles and clean energy. We also work with the Electric Vehicle Industry and local businesses to bring about change. <br><br>
        
        ​We also get the EV industry to interact with the community. We really love clean technologies like recycling, renewable energy (wind power, solar power, biomass, hydropower, biofuels) etc. We believe these technologies will power our transportation, homes and meet our energy needs in the future in a sustainable manner. <br><br>
        
        ​We have conceived Let Us Breathe and RE:LIVE events to promote EV’s and have promoted community charging by pioneering the idea of community charging stations, where communities open up their homes, offices ​and businesses for EV owners. <br><br>
